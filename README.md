This is my coding on python 3.12 and how I got Twitch Plays to work! Enjoy if this is your thing, I couldn't seem to get the keys to be held down with this format.

I took a lot of Inspiration of this from youtube videos I looked up, and after tinkering for a while it worked beautifully!

I encourage you to further add to this since it's open source! Happy coding everyone!
